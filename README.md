```


Entirely-in-browser, fully private LLM chatbot supporting Llama 3, Mistral and other open source models. 

- Fully private = No conversation data ever leaves your computer
- Runs in the browser = No server needed and no install needed!
- Works offline
- Easy-to-use interface on par with ChatGPT, but for open source LLMs

Big thanks to the inference engine provided by [webllm](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm).

## System Requirements

To run this, you need a modern browser with support for WebGPU. According to [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=WebGPU), WebGPU is supported on:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge

It's also available in Firefox, but it needs to be enabled manually through the dom.webgpu.enabled flag. Safari on MacOS also has experimental support for WebGPU which can be enabled through the WebGPU experimental feature. 

In addition to WebGPU support, various models might have specific RAM requirements.

## Try it out

You can [try it here](https://secretllama.com).

To compile the React code yourself, download the repo and then, run
